# vue-task-spa
Looking for work i came across this SPA Task

## Task ##
You are to create a great looking SPA example. Please document your investigation, considerations and finally the implementation.

## Requirements ##
Using Vue.JS, create a tabbed SPA which has the following fields
* title
* service - restrict options to 'Service 1','Service 2' & 'Service 3'
* quantity
* unit cost
* total cost (calculated)

Validation must be provided for editable fields; most importantly that they are filled in.

Each tab title must be `<title> - <total cost>` for that tab. Please use a tab colour to represent the different 'service' option.

The user needs to be able to add,remove and duplicate tabs.

At the bottom of the SPA, please have a 'submit' button that will; pending succesful field validation; show all of the tab information in JSON format. JSON structure to your chosing.

Most importantly; this must look incredible. Use whatever tricks you can in the short space of time to make the flow and feel for this form great.

Ideally the code will be well contained and easy to add to an existing page; as if it is a form that we want to add to multiple pages.
Submission
